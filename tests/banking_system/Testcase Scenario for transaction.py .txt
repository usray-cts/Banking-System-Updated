Sure, here are some scenarios that the function should be able to handle:

- **Positive deposit amount**
    - Deposit a small amount, e.g., 1
    - Deposit a large amount, e.g., 1,000,000
    - Deposit an amount with decimal places, e.g., 100.50

- **Zero deposit amount**
    - Deposit zero

- **Negative deposit amount**
    - Deposit a small negative amount, e.g., -1
    - Deposit a large negative amount, e.g., -1,000,000
    - Deposit a negative amount with decimal places, e.g., -100.50

- **Positive withdrawal amount**
    - Withdraw a small amount, e.g., 1
    - Withdraw a large amount, e.g., 1,000,000
    - Withdraw an amount with decimal places, e.g., 100.50

- **Zero withdrawal amount**
    - Withdraw zero

- **Negative withdrawal amount**
    - Withdraw a small negative amount, e.g., -1
    - Withdraw a large negative amount, e.g., -1,000,000
    - Withdraw a negative amount with decimal places, e.g., -100.50

- **Withdrawal amount greater than account balance**
    - Withdraw an amount that is slightly greater than the account balance, e.g., if balance is 100, withdraw 101
    - Withdraw an amount that is significantly greater than the account balance, e.g., if balance is 100, withdraw 1,000,000

- **Deposit and withdrawal in quick succession**
    - Deposit an amount, then immediately withdraw the same amount
    - Deposit an amount, then immediately withdraw a different amount
    - Deposit an amount, then immediately withdraw an amount greater than the deposit

- **Multiple deposits and withdrawals in quick succession**
    - Make multiple deposits and withdrawals in a random order, with varying amounts

- **Concurrent transactions**
    - Attempt to make multiple deposits or withdrawals at the same time (this would require a multithreaded test)
